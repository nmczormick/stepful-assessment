Take Home Assessment for Stepful

This take home assessment was completed using JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. For the UI components React Calendar was used to create the calendar and ChakraUI was used to create styled components.

In order to run the assessment, navigate to the backend directory and run "npm run dev"
Then in another terminal, open the frontend directory and run "npm run dev"

From the assessment, I was able to implement the following functionality in the 3 hour time frame:
1. Coaches can view their own upcoming slots
2. When a slot is booked, both the student and coach can view each otherâ€™s phone-number
3. Coaches should be able to review their past scores and notes for all of their calls

Please find images of the implementation below:

Due to the nature of the features I implemented, I created and populated the users and events databases in order to build out the UI. 

Troubleshooting:
If the UI does not load, navigate to the App.jsx file in the front end directory and run "command + S" and the UI should display
